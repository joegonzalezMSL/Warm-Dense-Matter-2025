I. Stable and Metastable Phases
A stable phase is a state of matter (solid, liquid, or gas) where the system has minimized its free energy at a given temperature and pressure. At equilibrium, the system has no net tendency to change its phase.
Sometimes, a system can exist in a state that is not the most stable but persists for some time. This is called a metastable phase. For example, liquid water can exist below its normal freezing point without crystallizing—this is known as supercooling. 
Thus, supercooling occurs when a liquid is cooled below its equilibrium freezing temperature but does not immediately crystallize. The farther the system is from equilibrium, the more unstable the metastable state becomes. Eventually, the system undergoes a phase transition to the more stable phase—here, the solid.
The lifetime of the metastable supercooled state decreases as the system moves further below the equilibrium temperature, eventually leading to nucleation of the solid phase.

II. Nucleation Fundamentals
When a liquid is cooled below its equilibrium freezing point, crystallization does not begin instantly. Instead, the transition to the solid phase starts with the formation of small crystalline clusters within the liquid. This process is called nucleation.
At first, atoms in the liquid may come together and form tiny crystalline embryos. However, most of these are unstable and dissolve back into the liquid. Only when a cluster reaches a certain size — called the critical nucleus size — does it become stable enough to keep growing. Below this size, surface effects dominate and the cluster is more likely to disappear; above this size, the reduction in energy from forming a solid outweighs the cost of creating new surfaces, and the nucleus grows spontaneously.
Nucleation reflects a balance between two competing free-energy contributions: the bulk term, which stabilizes the solid and drives growth, and the surface term, which penalizes the creation of a new interface. The balance between these two determines the critical size.
The nucleation rate — how quickly new solid clusters appear — depends strongly on temperature, or in other words, on supercoolings. Just below the melting point, the driving force for crystallization is small, so nucleation is very slow. As the liquid is cooled further, the driving force increases and nucleation becomes more likely. Important: if the system is cooled too quickly, atoms may not have enough time to rearrange into crystalline order, and the liquid can bypass nucleation, remaining in a metastable supercooled state or becoming an amorphous solid (glass).

Two types of nucleation can occur: (1) Homogeneous nucleation: Nuclei form randomly in the bulk liquid; (2) Heterogeneous nucleation: Nuclei form preferentially at surfaces, impurities, or defects, which lower the energy barrier and make nucleation easier. In practice, heterogeneous nucleation is far more common in real systems.

Once a stable nucleus forms, the process enters the growth stage, where atoms from the surrounding liquid attach to the solid cluster, and the crystal expands until the system transforms to the stable phase.

III. Molecular Dynamics Simulation
We use a reliable model for copper to explore its supercooled state and observe homogeneous, spontaneous crystal nucleation. The procedure is simple: we first heat a crystalline sample well above its melting temperature to ensure complete melting, and then cool it back down.
In the simulation, the main indicators of nucleation are: (1) A sudden drop in potential energy — this happens because atoms in the liquid adopt the more energetically favorable crystalline arrangement; (2) The emergence of ordered structures — initially small, but once stable nuclei form, they grow into a crystalline phase.

IV. Homework
Modify the cooling rate in the LAMMPS input file:
1) Slow down the cooling by factors of 10 and 100.
2) Speed it up by a factor of 10.
For each case, analyze the potential energy as a function of time. Compare how the cooling rate influences the onset of crystallization, the degree of supercooling reached, and the sharpness of the energy drop. Summarize your findings and explain how the rate of cooling controls the balance between remaining in the metastable liquid state and transitioning to the crystalline solid.
