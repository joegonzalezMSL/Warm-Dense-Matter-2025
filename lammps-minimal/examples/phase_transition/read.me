Stable and Metastable Phases
A stable phase is a state of matter (solid, liquid, or gas) where the system has minimized its free energy at given temperature and pressure. At equilibrium, the system has no net tendency to change its phase.
Sometimes, a system can exist in a state that is not the most stable but persists for some time. This is called a metastable phase. For example, liquid water can exist below its normal freezing point without crystallizing—this is known as supercooling. 
Thus, supercooling occurs when a liquid is cooled below its equilibrium freezing temperature but does not immediately crystallize. The farther the system is from equilibrium, the more unstable the metastable state becomes. Eventually, the system undergoes a phase transition to the more stable phase—here, the solid.
The lifetime of the metastable supercooled state decreases as the system moves further below the equilibrium temperature, eventually leading to nucleation of the solid phase.
