## Melting
Large-scale solid-liquid coexistence simulations to determine the melting temperature of Cu.

## Shock

## Phase Transition
We study crystallization in a supercooled copper liquid, focusing on homogeneous nucleation as the escape from metastability and showing how cooling rate dictates supercooling depth and the liquidâ€“solid transition.
